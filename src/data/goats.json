			"Chimi is a powerful doe with great body capacity, standing 22 inches at the withers. She has a long, level topline, straight front legs and nice rear leg angulation. Adorably frosted ears run in her family, making Chim look like a snow-flecked reindeer. She has a gleeful appetite for pasture and is occasionally eager enough to bust through the electric fence to the next paddock. She doesn’t have the elegant angularity of some dairy does, a quality are working to improve on with her offspring.",

			"With both parents from Castle Rock Farm, Chimi has superb dairy genetics. Her dam, Castle Rock Worth Every Penny 3*M *D, produced 740 pounds of milk in 247 days as a yearling first-freshener and 950 pounds in a 305-day second lactation. Her sire’s dam, GCH CRF Castle Rock Roxanne 1*M *D VEEE 91, also has quite the mammary reputation, having won Best Udder of Breed fourteen times.",

			"Chimi freshened in 2019 with a soft, well-attached, capacious udder with good teat placement and lovely open orifices, making her a joy to milk. She began milk test as a second freshener in 2022 and peaked at nearly 4 pounds per day. Since she had a summer freshening and is such an excellent producer we are milking her through in 2023 to see how long she can maintain production. She will soon earn her milk star and have complete DHIR records available.",

			"We feel so lucky to have begun our herd with such fine genetics. As the saying goes: “They say she’s a dime; I say she’s underrated.”"

			"Ina was among the first Bird’s Eye Farm-born goats, one of five girls born to two does in our first season. We lucked out! Ina has the same powerful, capacious build and tabletop line as her dam, Dime Piece (aka Chimi), but with a bit more graceful angularity (which seems to come from her paternal granddam). It’s a pleasure to watch the mother-daughter pair out on pasture since they’re both so lovely on the move. Ina is keen on finding the best snacking spots, which often means her face is in the grass inches from her mama’s nose.",
			"Ina is due to kid in late January 2023 and will be on milk test, eligible to become 5*M, following in the milky footsteps of her dam and granddam.",
			"Ina’s dam, Chimi, has a very well-formed, productive mammary system (pics below) and is a pleasure to milk. Chim is on extended lactation through 2023 and will earn her milk star very soon, having peaked near four pounds per day.",
			"Ina bears a striking resemblance to her paternal granddam, GCH Algedi Farm RB Ocean Flower 6*M *D EEEE 92. Ocean is a show ring and milk stand legend, producing 1080 lbs of milk on 305-day test in 2017 and making AGS Top Ten in 2016 for protein production."

She’s incredibly friendly and as a kid was always looking for a human lap in which to snuggle. In a herd with many gold coats, Zora stands out rocking her white-flecked-with-chocolate look.",
			"Her dam Zadie has a gorgeous, capacious udder and bestowed such patient maternal love that Zora was teat-fed until she was well over a year old.",
			"Zora has great genetics from both sides. Her Castle Rock lineage is rich with milk stars. And her paternal granddam GCH Algedi Farm RB Ocean Flower 6*M *D EEEE 92 is a show ring and milk stand legend, producing 1080 lbs of milk on 305-day test in 2017.",
			"Zora freshened in 2022 and milked nearly three pounds per day that summer. We are experimenting with extended lactations and staggered breedings; our expected schedule has her kidding again in 2024. We also plan to put her on test to earn her milk star at her second freshening."

			"Zadie is a petite, feminine doe who comes from a long line of stellar milkers. She stands 20.5” at the withers and has a level topline, straight front legs and nice rear leg angulation. Zadie has good body capacity and a mighty pretty little face. She’s a serious sweetheart, often going for the cuddles even before the treats. Petite though she is, Zadie is herd queen. When the goats head out to pasture she takes the lead.",

Her other granddam, SGCH Castle Rock Breakin My Heart 6*M 6*D VEEE 90, made Top Ten in ADGA’s protein production category in 2016—and gave 1210 pounds of milk that year.",
			"Zadie had such a smooth 2019 kidding that the first babe was on the ground before we could run from house to barn. She easily fed three kids, including her big wether Giannis. And she kept right on patiently feeding the pair we retained for well over a year. (Being curious about extended lactations, we find this a promising trait in terms of sustaining will to milk over a long period.) The long lactation did seem to wear on her, so she’s taking a well-earned break. Her daughter Zora has the same sweet disposition and elegant bearing as her dam and will be next up on our breeding schedule.",
			"Zadie’s first freshening udder was soft with great attachment and capacity, though her teat placement and orifices aren’t as ideal as her half-sister Chimi’s, so she took longer to milk out. Since our primary focus for 2019 was growing our herd, we let her kids hog the milk (as mentioned above), but Zadie was still giving us over a pound of milk each morning; we’d love to get her on milk test when she next freshens.",
			"Along with her half-sister, Chimi, Zadie makes up our foundational pair of does, and we couldn’t have wished for a finer duo to start our herd!"
