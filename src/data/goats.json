			"Zadie is a petite, feminine doe who comes from a long line of great milkers. She stands 20.5” at the withers and has a level topline, straight front legs and nice rear leg angulation. Zadie has good body capacity and a mighty pretty little face. She’s a serious sweetheart, often going for the cuddles even before the treats. Petite though she is, Zadie is herd queen. When we take walks she always needs to be out front.",
			"Her sire’s dam, GCH CRF Castle Rock Roxanne 1*M *D VEEE 91, is a star in the show ring and on the milkstand, winning Best Udder of Breed no less than fourteen times. Her other grand-dam, SGCH Castle Rock Breakin My Heart 6*M VEEE 90, made Top Ten in ADGA’s protein production category in 2016—and gave 1210 pounds of milk that year.",
			"She will be freshening for the first time in 2019 and we hope she passes on her dairy genetics and sweet disposition to her kids. Along with her half-sister, Chimi, Zadie makes up our foundational pair of does, and we couldn’t have wished for a finer duo to start our herd!"

			"Chimi is a powerful doe with great body capacity, standing 22 inches at the withers. She has a long, level topline, straight front legs and nice rear leg angulation. Adorably frosted ears run in her family, making Chim look like a snow-flecked reindeer. She has a gleeful appetite for pasture and is occasionally eager enough to bust through the electric fence to the next paddock.",
			"With both parents from Castle Rock Farm, Chimi has superb dairy genetics. Her dam, Castle Rock Worth Every Penny 3*M *D, produced 740 pounds of milk in 247 days as a yearling first-freshener and 950 pounds in a 305-day second lactation. Her sire’s dam, GCH CRF Castle Rock Roxanne 1*M *D VEEE 91, also has quite the mammary reputation, having won Best Udder of Breed fourteen times.",
			"In her first freshening Chimi developed a gorgeous, capacious udder with lovely openmaking her a pleasure to milk. We kept two of her daughters—because, who wouldn’t want more Chimis?—and let them nurse throughout her lactation. We figured it was worth giving up some milk to get extra hale and hearty doelings for our growing herd, though this also meant we didn’t get full production records. Still, she was giving us well over a pound of milk in the mornings, so when we are more competent milkers and she doesn’t have kids on her, I would bet she can do 3 lbs plus per day, like her dam. We alas weren’t able to get her on milk test as an FF (see the note on our Kidding Schedule page about 2019’s wild ride), but we’re excited to test when she freshens again, because this gal is destined to be a beast of a milker!",
			"Chimi is an all-around charmer and we feel ever so lucky to have begun our herd with such fine genetics. As the saying goes:  “They say she’s a dime; I say she’s underrated.”"
