			"Dime Piece, better known as Chimi, is a powerful doe with tremendous body capacity, standing 22 inches at the withers. She has a long, level topline, straight front legs and nice rear leg angulation. Chimi has a gleeful appetite for pasture, hay and anything that can be construed as a treat. She doesn’t have the elegant angularity of some dairy does, a quality are working to improve on with her offspring.",

She rocked an epic 570-day extended lactation in 2022-2023, peaking near 4 pounds per day and easily earning her 4*M designation. Filling a half-gallon jar with the day’s milk—from one little Nigie—is quite satisfying!",
			"With both parents from Castle Rock Farm, Chimi has superb dairy genetics. Her dam, Castle Rock Worth Every Penny 3*M *D GVEV 86, produced 740 pounds of milk in 247 days as a yearling first-freshener and 950 pounds in a 305-day second lactation. Her sire’s dam, GCH CRF Castle Rock Roxanne 1*M *D VEEE 91, has quite the mammary reputation, having won Best Udder of Breed fourteen times.",
			"Chimi and her half-sis Zadie are our foundation does, and we feel lucky to have begun our herd with such fine genetics. As the saying goes: \"They say she’s a dime; I say she’s underrated.\""

Ina earned her 5*M designation in 2023, following in some very milky matrilineal footsteps. We were thrilled to retain her gorgeous daughters Elena and Lizzo, who dream of being little 6*Ms one day.",

Ocean is a show ring and milk stand legend, and Ina inherited some of her granddam’s graceful angularity.

She’s not as long-bodied as her aunt Chimi or cousin Ina, but holds her own on the milk stand.",

			"Zadie had such a smooth 2019 kidding that the first babe was on the ground before we could run from house to barn. She easily fed three kids, including her big wether Giannis. And she kept right on patiently feeding the pair we retained for well over a year. (Being curious about extended lactations, we find this a promising trait in terms of sustaining will to milk over a long period.) The long lactation did seem to wear on her, so she’s taking a well-earned break. Her daughter Zora has the same sweet disposition and elegant bearing as her dam and will be next up on our breeding schedule.",
			"Zadie’s first freshening udder was soft with great attachment and capacity, though her teat placement and orifices aren’t as ideal as her half-sister Chimi’s, so she took longer to milk out. Since our primary focus for 2019 was growing our herd, we let her kids hog the milk (as mentioned above), but Zadie was still giving us over a pound of milk each morning; we’d love to get her on milk test when she next freshens.",
